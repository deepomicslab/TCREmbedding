## Tools involved in creating the dataset

### Negative data sampling

For binding prediction tasks and embedding visualization, we chose the best strategy discussed in the *TEINet project* to generate the negative samples. Refer to [sampler script](https://github.com/jiangdada1221/TEINet/blob/master/sampler.py).
